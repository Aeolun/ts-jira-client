   *  *  `filterId` \- ID of a filter that the user has permissions to view. Note, if the user does not have the 'Create shared objects' permission and tries to create a shared board, a private board will be created instead (remember that board sharing depends on the filter sharing).
   *  *  `location` \- The container that the board will be located in. `location` must include the `type` property (Valid values: project, user). If choosing 'project', then a project must be specified by a `projectKeyOrId` property in `location`. If choosing 'user', the current user is chosen by default. The `projectKeyOrId` property should not be provided.
   *
   * Note:
   *
   *  *  If you want to create a new project with an associated board, use the [Jira platform REST API](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest). For more information, see the [Create project](#api-rest-api-3-project-post) method. The `projectTypeKey` for software boards must be 'software' and the `projectTemplateKey` must be either `com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-kanban-template` or `com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-scrum-template`.
   *  *  You can create a filter using the [Jira REST API](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest). For more information, see the [Create filter](#api-rest-api-3-filter-post) method.
   *  *  If you do not ORDER BY the Rank field for the filter of your board, you will not be able to reorder issues on the board.
